SubCalc
=======
SubCalc, short for subnet calculator is a simple app I created while at Institute of Technology Carlow, Ireland.

By levereging HTML5 features supported at the time the app provided seamless offline mode by being fully cached on the client.

This repository is the source code used in the android app that was built using Cordova.
